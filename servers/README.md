# servers

This directory contains files related to the custom python server as well as the access point. The neccessary files are all except the __shell__ scripts. These are just quality of life scripts used to quickly start and stop the access point as some changes had to be made in the form of adding some routing rules and the deactivation/reactivation of some services.
